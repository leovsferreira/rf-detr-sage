# Grade Crossing Sensor Data Acquisition Plugin

This component serves as a data ingestion module for our AI-powered grade crossing assessment project.

The acquired imagery will be used in subsequent AI analysis stages. This data will be used to train and validate computer vision models designed to detect and assess potential hazards, monitor crossing equipment status, and understand traffic/pedestrian patterns.
